# PluginBase-Lamp

PluginBase-Lamp is a fork of the command library [Lamp](https://github.com/Revxrsal/Lamp) that has been adapted and
extended to work with my library [PluginBase](https://github.com/demengc/PluginBase).

Please see Lamp's original repository for information/documentation on its features and usage.

This fork is intended to be used in conjunction with PluginBase. Visit the PluginBase repository for more information.
